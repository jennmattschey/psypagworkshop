# PsyPAG 2016 Workshop
Code related to a workshop given at PsyPAG 2016. 

The workshop was aimed at postgraduate students with little to no experience in programming. 
Consequently, an attempt was made too keep the code as simple and accessible as possible. 

Other materials, such as cheat sheets and the workshop presentation, are available on jennmattschey.wordpress.com.
